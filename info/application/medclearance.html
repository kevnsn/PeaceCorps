<p>
After you have accepted your application and 60 days prior to your departure date, volunteers are required to complete a final physical and dental examination. At minimum, the medical examination will include some lab work, immunizations, and a dentist visit including x-rays. This medical evaluation is subject to change based upon the country you will be serving in. All materials requested from the medical staff must be returned no later than 30 days after your physical and dental examinations. The majority of applicants are medically cleared for service, though some require a placement with additional medical support, or cannot be placed.

<p class="note">
*Peace Corps is able to offer some limited cost-sharing reimbursements to cover medical examinations, but all other medical expenses are to be covered by the applicant’s insurance or the applicant.</p>
