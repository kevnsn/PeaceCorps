Before you leave for your country of service, all Peace Corps volunteers first go through a pre-service orientation known as a staging. As a Peace Corps “trainee”, you will meet the rest of your training group in the United States and will spend a few hours together bonding and preparing for service. From your staging, you will fly to your assigned country and begin your three months of in-country training followed by your service.
