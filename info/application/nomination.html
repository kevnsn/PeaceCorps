After the interview, the recruiter will evaluate whether or not you are qualified for Peace Corps service and if there are open positions that meet your skills. If the recruiter determines you to be qualified, they will nominate you to serve and give you a tentative departure date. You will be mailed a legal kit with fingerprint cards and the National Agency Checklist form that must be completed and returned to the Peace Corps before you can move forward in your application process.
