<li><strong>Paying and Living Expenses: </strong>The Peace Corps provides volunteers with complete dental and medical care during service, including shots, vaccinations, and medicines. It also covers transportation to and from the country of service. There is not a fee to participate in the Peace Corps. Volunteers are provided with a living allowance that enables one to live in a manner similar to the local people in his or her community. The allowance covers housing, food, and incidentals.</li><li><strong>
Deferment and Cancellation of Student Loans: </strong>School loan deferments exist for several federal programs (i.e., Stafford, Perkins, direct, and consolidates loans). Volunteers with Perkins loans may be eligible for a partial cancellation benefit. Some commercial loans may also be deferred during Peace Corps service. As the rules that authorize deferment are complicated and subject to change, it is best to talk to your lending institution about how this benefit applies to your particular situation. You are also welcome to use the “Instructions for Student Loans” and “Loan Deferment FAQ” information pages on the Peace Corps website. </li><li><strong>
Vacation Time and Visits:</strong> Volunteers receive two vacation days per month of service-total of 48 days over two years. Many volunteers use this time to travel to nearby countries. Some invite family or friends to visit so they can share their experience of their host country. Volunteers may also use vacation time to visit home (at their own expense).</li><li><strong>
Earn Funds for Transition:</strong> The Peace Corps recognizes that returning from overseas requires some adjustment, so when you complete your 27 months of training and service, it provides $7,425 (pre-tax) to help with the transition to life back home. The money is yours to use as you wish. </li>
