<p> Peace Corps offers two unique programs that combine graduate school with Peace Corps service:
</p>
<ul class="infolist">
<li><strong>Before and during Service:</strong> Masters International allows volunteers to incorporate Peace Corps service as credit in a master’s degree program in a variety of fields at more than 80 academic institutions nationwide. Prospective students apply separately to Peace Corps and to a participating graduate school. Once accepted to both, students will study on campus (usually for one year), and then spend the next two years earning academic credit while working overseas in a related Peace Corps project. Most schools provide students in this program with opportunities for research or teaching assistantships, scholarships, or tuition waivers for the credits earned while serving in the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps website has a searchable database with information about all Master’s International Programs.</li><li><strong>
After Service: </strong>Paul D. Coverdell Fellows Program offers returned Volunteers financial aid, such as scholarships and stipends, and professional internships at more than 70 partner schools. Master’s and doctoral programs are available in a wide range of disciplines. Volunteers who satisfactorily complete their Peace Corps service gain lifetime eligibility for the Coverdell Fellows Program. The Peace Corps website has a searchable database with information about all Coverdell Fellows Program partnerships. </li>
